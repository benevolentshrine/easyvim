## Financial Feasibility Summary

EasyVim is a **zero-cost project**. All software used (Neovim, Git, plugins) is free and open-source. We used our own laptops for development, so no hardware purchase was needed. GitHub provides free hosting for public repositories. The only resource we used was internet access, which we already have through college and home WiFi.

Since there are no expenses, this project is fully manageable within student resources. We did not need any funding or budget allocation.
